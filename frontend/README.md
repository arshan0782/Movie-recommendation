# 🎬 Movie Recommendation App (MERN + Groq AI)

This project is a **Movie Recommendation Web App** built using the **MERN stack** and **Groq AI (llama-3.1-8b-instant)**. The app takes a movie name as input and returns **similar movies with their release years**. Results are also **clickable**, redirecting users to Google search pages for quick details.

## 🧠 AI Model Used

We used the **llama-3.1-8b-instant** model:

* Highly accurate
* Free to use on Groq

---

##  API Endpoints

### **POST /api/movie**

Takes user input and returns a list of movies:

#### Request:

```json
{
  "query": "krish"
}
```

#### Response:

```json
{
  "movies": [
    { "title": "Baahubali", "year": "2015" },
    { "title": "Eega", "year": "2012" }
  ]
}
```

---

## 🧩 Backend Logic (Summary)

1. Receive movie name from frontend
2. Send query to Groq AI
3. Extract movie titles and years from AI response
4. Format output as array of objects
5. Return to frontend

---

## 🎨 Frontend Logic (Summary)

* User enters a movie name
* Sends it to backend using Axios
* Displays results in a card-like UI
* Each result is clickable (Google Search)

---

## ✔ How Clicking Works

Every movie result opens a Google search:

```

```

This helps user instantly view:

* IMDb rating
